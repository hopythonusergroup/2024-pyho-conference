## Grants

**Our Grant Program has Closed**

Whilst we aim to accommodate all attendees, regardless of age, race, gender, ethnicity, ability, or sexual orientation, by offering financial assistance to community members unable to attend.

We are assessing our budget and aiming to provide tickets as a simple form of grant to cover travel and lodging expenses.

Please do bear with us that Financial/Grant Aids from within/and surrounding areas of the region from attendees will be prioritized first.

Including:

- Speakers
- Those who will contribute back to their local communities
- Those who will help increase diversity at the event and in African programming

Please use the link below to request for a grant if you will need assistance to attend the conference.

### Refunds

- You will have to show a legal ID and conference badge for verification and identification before getting reimbursed.

<mark>Deadline for approval is August 29th, 2024.</mark>

**Please note, however that, our financial aide program will not cover all or exact expense for which you are requesting a grant for, hence you should be able to cover to some extent of the overall total cost - at least a one third of your total grant request**
